= Developer Hub - Supporting Developer Productivity

[NOTE]
====
**Module Status:** NEW CONTENT REQUIRED

This module needs to be created for the OpenShift Days 101 Ops Track.
Target version: OCP 4.20+ with Red Hat Developer Hub
====

== Module Overview

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes +
**Format:** Demo + Discussion +
**Audience:** IT Operations, Infrastructure Architects

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will understand:

* What Developer Hub (Red Hat's Backstage) is and why Ops should care
* How self-service portals reduce operational toil
* The relationship between Ops governance and developer autonomy
* How to support developers while maintaining control

== Content Outline

=== Part 1: The Developer Experience Problem (5 mins)

==== Traditional Model (Pre-DevHub)
**Developer asks Ops:**
* "Can I have a database?"
* "Can you create me a namespace?"
* "What's my Jenkins URL?"
* "How do I deploy to production?"

**Ops bottleneck:**
* Ticket queue grows
* Developers wait days
* Ops team overloaded with repetitive tasks

==== The Self-Service Solution
* **Developer Hub:** Internal Developer Portal
* Catalog of services, templates, and documentation
* Developers provision what they need (within guardrails)
* Ops defines what's available

=== Part 2: What is Red Hat Developer Hub? (5 mins)

==== Based on Backstage (CNCF)
* Open source developer portal platform
* Created by Spotify, now CNCF project
* Red Hat productized version = Developer Hub

==== Key Features

**Software Catalog:**
* All applications, APIs, services in one place
* Who owns what
* Service dependencies

**Software Templates (Golden Paths):**
* Pre-approved application scaffolding
* "Create a Spring Boot app" in 3 clicks
* Ops controls the template (security, standards)

**TechDocs:**
* Documentation as code
* Markdown docs alongside app code
* Always up-to-date

**Plugins Ecosystem:**
* Kubernetes plugin - see deployments, pods
* ArgoCD plugin - deployment status
* Tekton plugin - pipeline runs
* And dozens more

=== Part 3: The Ops Perspective - Why You Should Care (5 mins)

==== It's About Governance, Not Access

**Without Dev Hub:**
* Developers ask for "root access"
* Ops says "no" (security concern)
* Deadlock and shadow IT

**With Dev Hub:**
* Ops creates "Golden Path" templates
* Developers self-service *approved* patterns
* Ops maintains control via the template

==== Example: Database Provisioning

**Traditional:**
1. Developer opens ticket: "Need PostgreSQL"
2. Ops manually provisions
3. 3-5 day turnaround
4. Developer doesn't know connection string location

**Dev Hub Approach:**
1. Developer clicks "Provision Database" template
2. Ops-approved template runs:
   * Creates namespace (within quota limits Ops set)
   * Deploys Postgres operator
   * Creates database
   * Stores credentials in Vault
   * Updates service catalog
3. Done in 5 minutes
4. Ops never touched it, but controls the *how*

=== Part 4: Demo - Developer Hub UI Tour (10 mins)

[NOTE]
====
This demo requires Developer Hub to be pre-installed on the cluster.
If not available, use screenshots or recorded demo.
====

==== Step 1: Access Developer Hub

Navigate to the Developer Hub URL (typically deployed as a Route):

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get route backstage-developer-hub -n rhdh
----

==== Step 2: Explore the Software Catalog

**Show participants:**
1. **Home:** Dashboard view
2. **Catalog:** All registered components
   * Click on an application
   * Show dependencies
   * Show owner information
   * Show deployment status

==== Step 3: Create from Template (The "Golden Path")

**Demo the self-service flow:**

1. Click **Create** → **Choose a template**
2. Select "Spring Boot Microservice" (or similar)
3. Fill in the form:
   * Application name
   * Description
   * Git repository location
4. Click **Create**

**What happens behind the scenes (explain while it runs):**
* Template creates Git repo
* Scaffolds application code
* Creates OpenShift resources (Deployment, Service, Route)
* Configures CI/CD pipeline
* Registers app in catalog
* All using *Ops-approved* patterns

5. Show the created app in Catalog
6. Navigate to OpenShift - show the running app

==== Step 4: Show the Ops View

**Click into Kubernetes plugin:**
* Show running pods
* Show resource consumption
* Show logs

**Point out to Ops attendees:**
* "The developer provisioned this themselves"
* "But you (Ops) controlled the template"
* "It respects quotas and limits you set"
* "It uses approved base images"
* "It has monitoring/logging configured automatically"

=== Part 5: Implementation Discussion (5 mins)

==== What Ops Needs to Do

**1. Install Developer Hub**
[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
# Install Red Hat Developer Hub operator
oc apply -f developer-hub-operator-subscription.yaml
----

**2. Create Templates (Golden Paths)**
* Define organization-approved patterns
* Example templates:
  - Microservice (Spring Boot, Quarkus, Node.js)
  - Database
  - Message Queue
  - Full app stack

**3. Integrate with Existing Systems**
* Connect to Git (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea)
* Connect to CI/CD (Tekton, Jenkins)
* Connect to Monitoring (Prometheus)
* Connect to identity provider (LDAP, OAuth)

**4. Governance Configuration**
* What can developers do?
* What needs approval?
* Resource limits per template

== Resources Required

* [ ] Developer Hub pre-installed (or demo recording)
* [ ] Sample software templates configured
* [ ] Sample applications registered in catalog
* [ ] Integration with OpenShift cluster

== The "Tee Up" Strategy

**This module is designed to:**
* Show Ops teams that self-service doesn't mean chaos
* Demonstrate governance through templates
* Bridge to "Phase 2" (Dev Track) discussions
* Plant seed for Platform Engineering roadshow

**Follow-up opportunities:**
* "Want to build custom templates? We have a Platform Engineering workshop"
* "Interested in full Internal Developer Platform? Let's talk"

* https://backstage.io/docs/overview/what-is-backstage

**Key Messages (Ops Angle):**
* Developer Hub is not "giving away the keys"
* It's *scaling* your governance
* You define the guardrails, devs operate within them
* Reduces Ops toil while maintaining control

**Required Assets:**
* Need a cluster with Developer Hub operator
* Pre-built software templates
* Coordination with Developer Hub product team for content review

**Talking Points for Different Personas:**

*For IT Directors:*
* Faster time-to-market
* Reduce Ops headcount pressure
* Maintain compliance and governance

*For Infrastructure Architects:*
* Standardization across teams
* Platform as a Product
* Integration architecture

*For IT Operations:*
* Less repetitive tickets
* Focus on platform, not individual apps
* Template once, reuse forever
