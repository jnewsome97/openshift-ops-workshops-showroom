= Debugging & Troubleshooting

== Module Overview

**Duration:** 30-35 minutes +
**Format:** Hands-on Lab - Real Problem Solving +
**Audience:** IT Operations, SRE, Platform Engineers

**Workshop Narrative Context:**

We've learned how to:
- Deploy and manage applications
- Enable developer self-service
- Set governance policies

**Now:** What happens when things **go wrong**? How do we diagnose and fix issues quickly?

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Diagnose the 10 most common OpenShift issues
* Use `oc` CLI commands for troubleshooting
* Read pod events and logs effectively
* Understand resource constraints and quota issues
* Fix ImagePullBackOff and CrashLoopBackOff errors
* Troubleshoot networking problems

== The Ops Reality: Things Break

**Common Support Tickets:**

* "My app won't start" - CrashLoopBackOff
* "Deployment stuck" - ImagePullBackOff
* "Pod is Pending forever" - Resource constraints
* "Can't reach my service" - Networking issues
* "App deleted my data" - Missing PersistentVolume
* "Environment variables not working" - ConfigMap/Secret issues

**This module:** Hands-on practice fixing real issues.

== Troubleshooting Methodology

Before diving into specific issues, here's the Ops playbook:

[source]
----
1. Observe - What's the symptom?
   → Check pod status, events, logs

2. Orient - What changed recently?
   → Check deployment history, recent changes

3. Decide - What's the root cause?
   → Analyze events, resource limits, networking

4. Act - Apply the fix
   → Update deployment, add resources, fix config

5. Verify - Did it work?
   → Check pod is Running, test the app
----

== Essential Troubleshooting Commands

Here are your diagnostic tools:

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
# Pod status overview
oc get pods -n <namespace>

# Detailed pod info (includes events!)
oc describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>

# Container logs
oc logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
oc logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> --previous  # Previous crash

# Events (sorted by time)
oc get events -n <namespace> --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# Resource usage
oc adm top pods -n <namespace>
oc adm top nodes

# Deployment status
oc describe deployment <name> -n <namespace>

# ReplicaSet status (shows pod creation issues)
oc describe rs -n <namespace>
----

**Bookmark these commands** - you'll use them constantly.

== Lab Setup: Deploy Broken Applications

First, let's create a namespace and deploy several intentionally broken applications that you'll diagnose and fix.

=== Create the Lab Namespace

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc new-project ops-track-demo
----

=== Deploy the Broken Applications

We'll deploy real applications with realistic misconfigurations - the kind of issues you'll actually encounter in production.

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnewsome97/openshift-ops-workshops-showroom/main/support/broken-apps.yaml
----

This deploys 5 broken applications:

[cols="2,2,3"]
|===
|App |Issue |Root Cause

|**weather-frontend**
|ImagePullBackOff
|Wrong image tag (1.2.1 doesn't exist)

|**weather-api**
|CrashLoopBackOff
|Startup check fails (missing config file)

|**weather-cache**
|Pod not created
|Resource typo (512Gi instead of 512Mi)

|**weather-backend**
|CreateContainerConfigError
|Missing ConfigMap reference

|**weather-proxy**
|Service unreachable
|Selector typo (proxi vs proxy)
|===

=== Deploy a Working App for Comparison

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jnewsome97/openshift-ops-workshops-showroom/main/support/working-app.yaml
----

=== Create Routes

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc expose svc weather-proxy -n ops-track-demo
oc expose svc weathernow -n ops-track-demo
----

=== Wait for Issues to Manifest

Give the cluster a moment to try scheduling these pods:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
sleep 30
----

=== Verify Broken State

Now let's see the chaos we've created:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo
----

You should see several pods in error states - this is expected! Your job is to fix them.

== Hands-On: Troubleshooting Lab

We've deployed several "broken" applications. Let's fix them!

=== Setup: View Problem Applications

Let's see what's broken:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo
----

You should see several pods in error states:

----
NAME                              READY   STATUS                       RESTARTS
weather-frontend-xxxxx            0/1     ImagePullBackOff             0
weather-api-xxxxx                 0/1     CrashLoopBackOff             3
weather-backend-xxxxx             0/1     CreateContainerConfigError   0
weather-cache-xxxxx               0/1     (not created - check RS)     0
weather-proxy-xxxxx               1/1     Running                      0
weathernow-xxxxx                  1/1     Running                      0
----

**Goal:** Fix all the broken apps.

== Problem 1: ImagePullBackOff

=== Symptom

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-frontend
----

Output:

----
NAME                              READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
weather-frontend-xxxxx            0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          2m
----

**Status: `ImagePullBackOff`** - Can't pull the container image.

=== Step 1: Describe the Pod

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc describe pod -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-frontend
----

Look at the **Events** section at the bottom:

----
Events:
  Type     Reason     Message
  ----     ------     -------
  Normal   Scheduled  Successfully assigned ops-track-demo/weather-frontend-xxxxx to worker-1
  Normal   Pulling    Pulling image "quay.io/openshifttest/hello-openshift:1.2.1"
  Warning  Failed     Failed to pull image: manifest unknown
  Warning  Failed     Error: ImagePullBackOff
----

**Root Cause:** The image tag `1.2.1` doesn't exist - it's a typo!

=== Step 2: Check the Image in the Deployment

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get deployment weather-frontend -n ops-track-demo -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
----

Output:

----
quay.io/openshifttest/hello-openshift:1.2.1
----

**Problem identified:** Wrong image tag - should be `1.2.0` not `1.2.1`.

=== Step 3: Fix the Image Tag

Let's update to the correct tag:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set image deployment/weather-frontend weather-frontend=quay.io/openshifttest/hello-openshift:1.2.0 -n ops-track-demo
----

Output:

----
deployment.apps/weather-frontend image updated
----

=== Step 4: Verify the Fix

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-frontend
----

You should now see:

----
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
weather-frontend-xxxxx            1/1     Running   0          30s
----

**✅ Fixed!** The pod is now Running.

=== Key Takeaway

**ImagePullBackOff** usually means:

* Image doesn't exist (typo in name/tag)
* Image is in a private registry (need credentials)
* No pull secret configured
* Network issue reaching registry

**Fix:** Update image name or add pull secret.

== Problem 2: CrashLoopBackOff

=== Symptom

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-api
----

Output:

----
NAME                           READY   STATUS             RESTARTS     AGE
weather-api-xxxxx              0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   5 (2m ago)   10m
----

**Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`** - Container starts, then immediately crashes. Kubernetes keeps restarting it.

=== Step 1: Check the Logs

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc logs -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-api
----

Output:

----
Error: Missing required config file /etc/weather/config.yaml
----

The container is failing because it can't find a required config file!

=== Step 2: Check the Previous Container

The current container might not have logs yet. Check the previous crash:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc logs -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-api --previous
----

Output:

----
Error: Missing required config file /etc/weather/config.yaml
----

Same error. The startup check is looking for a config file that doesn't exist.

=== Step 3: Describe the Pod for Events

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc describe pod -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-api
----

Look at the **Events**:

----
Events:
  Type     Reason     Message
  ----     ------     -------
  Normal   Created    Created container weather-api
  Normal   Started    Started container weather-api
  Warning  BackOff    Back-off restarting failed container weather-api in pod weather-api-xxxxx
----

**Key Event:** "Back-off restarting failed container"

=== Step 4: Check the Container Command

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get deployment weather-api -n ops-track-demo -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].command}'
----

Output:

----
["/bin/sh","-c","echo 'Error: Missing required config file /etc/weather/config.yaml' && exit 1"]
----

**Root Cause:** Someone added a startup check that fails because the config file doesn't exist!

=== Step 5: Fix by Removing the Custom Command

The image has its own default entrypoint. Let's remove the custom command that's causing the failure:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc patch deployment weather-api -n ops-track-demo --type='json' -p='[
  {
    "op": "remove",
    "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/command"
  }
]'
----

This removes the custom command and lets the container use its default entrypoint.

=== Step 6: Verify the Fix

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-api
----

You should see:

----
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
weather-api-xxxxx              1/1     Running   0          15s
----

**✅ Fixed!** The pod is now Running.

=== Key Takeaway

**CrashLoopBackOff** usually means:

* Application code has a bug (crashes on startup)
* Missing configuration (env var, ConfigMap, Secret)
* Wrong command/entrypoint
* Failed health checks
* Out of memory (OOMKilled)

**Debug with:** `oc logs` (current and `--previous`) + `oc describe pod`

== Problem 3: Pod Not Created (Resource Constraints)

=== Symptom

Check the deployments - one shows `0/1` READY:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get deployment weather-cache -n ops-track-demo
----

Output:

----
NAME            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
weather-cache   0/1     0            0           5m
----

No pods exist, and no pods are even Pending. Why?

=== Step 1: Check ReplicaSet Events

Since the pod isn't being created, check the ReplicaSet:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc describe rs -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-cache
----

Look at the **Events**:

----
Events:
  Type     Reason        Message
  ----     ------        -------
  Warning  FailedCreate  Error creating: Pod "weather-cache-xxxxx" is invalid:
                         spec.containers[0].resources.requests: Invalid value: "512Gi":
                         must be less than or equal to memory limit of 2Gi
----

**Root Cause:** Resource requests exceed the LimitRange constraints! Someone typed `512Gi` instead of `512Mi`.

=== Step 2: Check Resource Requests

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get deployment weather-cache -n ops-track-demo -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources}' | python3 -m json.tool
----

Output:

----
{
    "limits": {
        "cpu": "500m",
        "memory": "1Ti"
    },
    "requests": {
        "cpu": "100m",
        "memory": "512Gi"
    }
}
----

**Problem:** Requesting `512Gi` memory - a copy/paste error (should be `512Mi`)!

=== Step 3: Check LimitRange

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc describe limitrange resource-limits -n ops-track-demo
----

Output shows:

----
Type        Resource  Min  Max   Default Request  Default Limit
----        --------  ---  ---   ---------------  -------------
Container   cpu       -    2     100m             500m
Container   memory    -    2Gi   128Mi            512Mi
----

Max memory is 2Gi, but we requested 512Gi!

=== Step 4: Fix the Resource Requests

Update to reasonable values (512Mi not 512Gi):

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc set resources deployment/weather-cache -n ops-track-demo \
  --requests=cpu=100m,memory=512Mi \
  --limits=cpu=500m,memory=1Gi
----

=== Step 5: Verify the Fix

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-cache
----

You should now see:

----
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
weather-cache-xxxxx             1/1     Running   0          20s
----

**✅ Fixed!** The pod is now Running.

=== Key Takeaway

**Pods fail to create** when:

* Resource requests exceed LimitRange constraints
* Resource requests exceed namespace ResourceQuota
* No nodes have enough capacity
* NodeSelector/Affinity rules can't be satisfied
* PersistentVolumeClaim doesn't exist

**Debug with:** `oc describe rs` and `oc get events`

== Problem 4: Missing ConfigMap

=== Symptom

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-backend
----

Output:

----
NAME                              READY   STATUS                       RESTARTS   AGE
weather-backend-xxxxx             0/1     CreateContainerConfigError   0          5m
----

**Status: `CreateContainerConfigError`** - The container can't be created due to a configuration problem.

=== Step 1: Describe the Pod

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc describe pod -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-backend
----

Look at the **Events**:

----
Events:
  Type     Reason     Message
  ----     ------     -------
  Normal   Scheduled  Successfully assigned ops-track-demo/weather-backend-xxxxx to worker-1
  Normal   Pulling    Pulling image "quay.io/openshifttest/hello-openshift:1.2.0"
  Normal   Pulled     Successfully pulled image
  Warning  Failed     Error: configmap "weather-config" not found
----

**Root Cause:** The deployment expects a ConfigMap called `weather-config` but it doesn't exist!

=== Step 2: Check What ConfigMap is Expected

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get deployment weather-backend -n ops-track-demo -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].envFrom}' | python3 -m json.tool
----

Output:

----
[
    {
        "configMapRef": {
            "name": "weather-config"
        }
    }
]
----

**Problem:** The deployment is configured to load environment variables from `weather-config`, but no one created it!

=== Step 3: Create the Missing ConfigMap

Create the ConfigMap with the configuration the app needs:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc create configmap weather-config -n ops-track-demo \
  --from-literal=API_URL=http://api.weather.example.com \
  --from-literal=CACHE_TTL=300 \
  --from-literal=LOG_LEVEL=info
----

=== Step 4: Verify the Fix

The pod should automatically retry. Check its status:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-backend
----

If still in error state, restart the deployment:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc rollout restart deployment/weather-backend -n ops-track-demo
----

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-backend
----

Now it should be Running:

----
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
weather-backend-xxxxx             1/1     Running   0          30s
----

**✅ Fixed!** The pod is now Running.

=== Key Takeaway

**CreateContainerConfigError** usually means:

* ConfigMap doesn't exist
* Secret doesn't exist
* Wrong name referenced in deployment
* ConfigMap/Secret in wrong namespace

**Debug with:** `oc describe pod` → look for "configmap not found" or "secret not found"

== Problem 5: Service Can't Reach Pod (Selector Mismatch)

=== Symptom

The weather-proxy pod is Running, but the route returns an error:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-proxy
----

Output:

----
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
weather-proxy-xxxxx              1/1     Running   0          10m
----

Pod is running! But test the route:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
curl -s http://$(oc get route weather-proxy -n ops-track-demo -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}') | head -5
----

Output:

----
<html>
  <head><title>Application is not available</title>
----

**Problem:** The app is running but can't be reached!

=== Step 1: Check Service Endpoints

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get endpoints weather-proxy -n ops-track-demo
----

Output:

----
NAME            ENDPOINTS   AGE
weather-proxy   <none>      10m
----

**Red flag:** No endpoints! The service isn't routing to any pods.

=== Step 2: Compare Service Selector vs Pod Labels

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
echo "Service selector:"
oc get svc weather-proxy -n ops-track-demo -o jsonpath='{.spec.selector}'
echo ""
echo "Pod labels:"
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo -l app=weather-proxy --show-labels
----

Output:

----
Service selector:
{"app":"weather-proxi"}
Pod labels:
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
weather-proxy-xxxxx              1/1     Running   0          10m   app=weather-proxy,version=v1
----

**Root Cause:** Service selector has `weather-proxi` (typo!) but pod label is `weather-proxy`.

=== Step 3: Fix the Service Selector

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc patch svc weather-proxy -n ops-track-demo --type='json' -p='[
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/spec/selector/app",
    "value": "weather-proxy"
  }
]'
----

=== Step 4: Verify Endpoints Now Exist

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get endpoints weather-proxy -n ops-track-demo
----

Output:

----
NAME            ENDPOINTS         AGE
weather-proxy   10.128.2.45:8080  10m
----

**Endpoints populated!**

=== Step 5: Test the Route Again

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
curl -s http://$(oc get route weather-proxy -n ops-track-demo -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----

Output:

----
Hello OpenShift!
----

**✅ Fixed!** The service now routes to the pod.

=== Key Takeaway

**"Application not available"** with Running pods usually means:

* Service selector doesn't match pod labels (typo!)
* Service port doesn't match container port
* NetworkPolicy blocking traffic
* Pod not ready (readiness probe failing)

**Debug with:** `oc get endpoints` - if empty, check selector vs labels

== Common Issue Quick Reference

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Status |Meaning |First Check

|**ImagePullBackOff**
|Can't pull container image

|`oc describe pod` → Events → Check readiness probe config
|===

== Additional Troubleshooting Scenarios

=== Scenario: Service Not Reachable

**Symptom:** Can't access app via Route or Service.

**Diagnostic steps:**

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
# Check if service exists
oc get svc -n <namespace>

# Check service endpoints (are pods registered?)
oc get endpoints <service-name> -n <namespace>

# If endpoints are empty, check pod labels match service selector
oc get pods --show-labels -n <namespace>
oc get svc <service-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.spec.selector}'

# Check if route exists
oc get route -n <namespace>

# Test from another pod
oc run test-pod --image=curlimages/curl --rm -it -- curl http://<service-name>:<port>
----

**Common causes:**

* Pod labels don't match Service selector
* Service port configuration wrong
* Route not created
* NetworkPolicy blocking traffic

=== Scenario: Persistent Volume Issues

**Symptom:** Pod stuck in `Pending` with message "PVC not bound".

**Diagnostic steps:**

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
# Check PVC status
oc get pvc -n <namespace>

# Describe PVC for events
oc describe pvc <pvc-name> -n <namespace>

# Check if StorageClass exists
oc get storageclass

# Check available PVs
oc get pv
----

**Common causes:**

* StorageClass doesn't exist
* No PVs available (static provisioning)
* Dynamic provisioner not working
* Access mode mismatch (ReadWriteOnce vs ReadWriteMany)

=== Scenario: Readiness Probe Failing

**Symptom:** Pod shows `0/1 READY` but is Running.

**Diagnostic steps:**

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
# Check readiness probe status
oc describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
----

Look for:

----
Readiness:  http-get http://:8080/health delay=0s timeout=1s period=10s #success=1 #failure=3
----

Check **Events**:

----
Warning  Unhealthy  Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 503
----

**Fix:**

* Check if app actually exposes the health endpoint
* Verify the port is correct
* Check if app is slow to start (increase `initialDelaySeconds`)
* Ensure health endpoint returns 200 status

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
# Update readiness probe
oc set probe deployment/<name> --readiness \
  --get-url=http://:8080/healthz \
  --initial-delay-seconds=30 \
  --timeout-seconds=5
----

== Debugging with oc debug

Sometimes you need to **get inside a failing environment**.

=== Debug a Running Pod

Start a debug session:

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
# Start debug shell in a running pod
oc debug pod/<pod-name> -n <namespace>

# Or debug a deployment (creates debug pod)
oc debug deployment/<name> -n <namespace>
----

**Inside the debug pod:**

[source,bash]
----
# Check filesystem
ls -la /app

# Check environment variables
env | sort

# Test network connectivity
curl http://other-service:8080

# Check DNS resolution
nslookup other-service
----

=== Debug a Node

Sometimes you need to troubleshoot at the node level:

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
# Start debug session on a node
oc debug node/<node-name>

# Inside the debug pod (chroot to node filesystem)
chroot /host

# Now you can run node-level commands
systemctl status kubelet
journalctl -u kubelet -n 50
crictl ps
----

**Use case:** Investigate node-level issues (disk full, kubelet errors, etc.)

== Collecting Support Data

If you need to escalate to Red Hat Support:

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
# Collect must-gather data
oc adm must-gather

# This creates a directory with comprehensive cluster diagnostics:
# - All pod logs

== Final Verification: All Issues Resolved

Now that we've fixed all the broken apps, let's verify everything is working correctly.

=== Step 1: Check All Pods Are Running

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo
----

You should see **ALL pods in Running state**:

----
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
weather-frontend-xxxxx            1/1     Running   0          5m
weather-api-xxxxx                 1/1     Running   0          5m
weather-backend-xxxxx             1/1     Running   0          5m
weather-cache-xxxxx               1/1     Running   0          5m
weather-proxy-xxxxx               1/1     Running   0          5m
weathernow-xxxxx                  1/1     Running   0          30m
----

✅ **Success Criteria:** All pods show `Running` status and `1/1 Ready`

=== Step 2: Verify Apps Are Accessible

Test that the apps actually work:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
# Test the weather-proxy route (the one we fixed the selector for)
curl -s http://$(oc get route weather-proxy -n ops-track-demo -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')

# Test the weathernow route
curl -s http://$(oc get route weathernow -n ops-track-demo -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----

If you see `Hello OpenShift!` output, the apps are working! ✅

=== Step 3: Clean Summary of What We Fixed

Let's document what we accomplished:

[cols="2,2,2,1"]
|===
|App |Original Issue |Root Cause |Status

|**weather-frontend**
|ImagePullBackOff
|Wrong image tag (1.2.1 vs 1.2.0)
|✅ Fixed

|**weather-api**
|CrashLoopBackOff
|Startup check fails (missing config file)
|✅ Fixed

|**weather-cache**
|Pod not created
|Resource typo (512Gi vs 512Mi)
|✅ Fixed

|**weather-backend**
|CreateContainerConfigError
|Missing ConfigMap
|✅ Fixed

|**weather-proxy**
|Service unreachable
|Selector typo (proxi vs proxy)
|✅ Fixed
|===

=== Step 4: Quick Validation Commands

Keep these handy for future troubleshooting:

[source,bash,role="copypaste"]
----
# Quick health check
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo --field-selector=status.phase!=Running

# If this returns nothing, all pods are healthy!

# Check for any pods with restarts (may indicate issues)
oc get pods -n ops-track-demo --field-selector=status.phase=Running | grep -v "0/1"

# View recent events (should be mostly normal now)
oc get events -n ops-track-demo --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' | tail -10
----

=== What You Learned

**Troubleshooting Skills Gained:**

✅ Diagnosed ImagePullBackOff by checking pod events
✅ Fixed CrashLoopBackOff by analyzing container command
✅ Resolved resource constraint issues with LimitRange
✅ Fixed quota exhaustion by increasing limits
✅ Resolved missing ConfigMap dependencies
✅ Applied the Observe → Orient → Decide → Act → Verify methodology

**Operational Confidence:**

You can now:
- Quickly identify the top 5-10 most common OpenShift issues
- Use the right diagnostic commands for each problem type
- Methodically troubleshoot and fix issues
- Verify fixes are actually working (not just "looks good")

**The workshop environment is now clean and ready for the next module!** ✅

== Key Takeaways

✅ **Events are gold** - Always check `oc describe pod` +
✅ **Logs tell the story** - Use `oc logs` and `--previous` +
✅ **Resource constraints** - Check quotas and LimitRanges +
✅ **Methodical approach** - Observe → Orient → Decide → Act → Verify +
✅ **Common patterns** - Most issues fall into 5-10 categories +
✅ **Debug interactively** - Use `oc debug` when needed +
✅ **Always verify fixes** - Don't assume it's fixed, confirm with `oc get pods`
