= Platform Engineering - Red Hat Developer Hub

== Module Overview

**Duration:** 15-20 minutes +
**Format:** Dashboard exploration + Demo +
**Audience:** IT Operations, Platform Engineers, Infrastructure Architects

**Workshop Narrative Context:**

We've learned how to:
- Secure workloads with RHACS
- Enforce governance policies
- Monitor compliance

**Now:** How do we **enable developer self-service** while maintaining operational control? How do we reduce repetitive requests and tickets?

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Understand what RHDH provides to developers (self-service templates)
* See how RHDH reduces ticket-based requests and manual provisioning
* Verify RHDH deployment health and status
* Monitor and troubleshoot RHDH as part of your platform infrastructure

== What is Red Hat Developer Hub?

**Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)** is an **enterprise-grade Internal Developer Platform** based on Backstage.

Think of it as: **Your organization's developer self-service portal**

=== The Operations Problem It Solves

**Before RHDH:**

* Developers submit tickets: "Create me a new app with CI/CD"
* Ops manually provisions: namespace, RBAC, quotas, pipeline, git repo
* Process takes days or weeks
* Inconsistent configurations
* Documentation scattered everywhere

**With RHDH:**

* Developer clicks "Create New App" in portal
* Template automatically provisions: namespace, RBAC, quotas, pipeline, git repo
* Process takes minutes
* **Ops-defined golden paths** ensure consistency
* Self-service with governance built-in

=== Key Capabilities

* **Software Catalog** - Unified view of all services, APIs, libraries
* **Software Templates** - Self-service app creation with Ops-approved patterns
* **TechDocs** - Documentation integrated with code
* **Plugins** - Integrate with tools (ArgoCD, Tekton, Jira, etc.)
* **RBAC** - Fine-grained access control
* **API Integration** - Connect to existing systems

== RHDH Architecture (Quick Overview)

RHDH on OpenShift consists of:

* **Backstage Frontend** - Web portal UI
* **Backstage Backend** - API and orchestration layer
* **PostgreSQL Database** - Stores catalog and configuration
* **Plugins** - Extend functionality (Kubernetes, Tekton, ArgoCD, etc.)

All of this was deployed via the **Red Hat Developer Hub Operator** from OperatorHub.

== Part 1: Verify RHDH Deployment

=== Step 1: Check RHDH Pods

Verify the RHDH pods are running:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n backstage
----

You should see:

----
NAME                                       READY   STATUS
backstage-developer-hub-xxxxx              1/1     Running
backstage-psql-developer-hub-0             1/1     Running
----

Check the deployment details:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get deployment -n backstage
----

View the Backstage container resources:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get deployment backstage-developer-hub -n backstage -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].resources}' | python3 -m json.tool
----

=== Step 2: Get the Developer Hub URL

Get the Developer Hub portal URL:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get route backstage-developer-hub -n backstage -o jsonpath='https://{.spec.host}'
----

Output:

----
https://backstage-developer-hub-backstage.apps.cluster-GUID.example.com
----

View all routes in the backstage namespace:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get routes -n backstage
----

=== Step 3: Access the Portal

1. **Open the Developer Hub URL** in a new browser tab
2. You'll see the **Red Hat Developer Hub** login page
3. Select **Guest** to enter without authentication

Click **Enter** under Guest to access the portal.

You're now in the **Developer Hub Portal**.

== Part 2: See What Developers Get

The portal is empty because no software templates have been registered yet. Let's import the **official Red Hat Developer Hub demo templates** so you can see what developers experience when using self-service.

=== Step 4: Register Official Templates

1. On the Home screen, you'll see the **Explore Your Software Catalog** section with a message: "No software catalog added yet"

image::rhdh-register-component.png[Register a component button on home screen]

2. Click **Register a component**
3. Enter the following URL:

----
https://github.com/redhat-developer/red-hat-developer-hub-software-templates/blob/48056c57dbfcdcf2a7075819745b0203d1a8a42e/templates.yaml
----

4. Click **Analyze**
5. You'll see a list of entities to be added to the catalog (argocd-template, go-backend-template, nodejs-backend-template, quarkus-backend-template, spring-boot-backend-template, tekton-template, and more)

image::rhdh-import-templates.png[Templates discovered after analyzing the URL]

6. Click **Import**

=== Step 5: Explore the Templates

After import, click **Create** in the left sidebar. You'll now see available templates including:

* **Quarkus Backend** - Java microservice with Quarkus and CI pipeline
* **Spring Boot Backend** - Java microservice with Spring
* **Node.js Backend** - JavaScript/TypeScript service
* **Go Backend** - Go microservice
* **ArgoCD** - GitOps application setup
* **Tekton** - CI/CD pipeline templates

Click on the **Quarkus Backend** template. You'll see:

* **Description:** "Create a starter Quarkus Backend application with a CI pipeline"
* **Owner:** janus-authors
* **Type:** service
* **Tags:** quarkus, java, maven
* **Actions:** View Source, View TechDocs, Launch Template

NOTE: You may see a warning: "This entity has relations to other entities, which can't be found in the catalog." This is expected - the demo templates reference owner groups that aren't configured in this cluster.

Click **Launch Template** to see the input form (you can explore without executing).

**Key insight for Ops:** These templates are YAML files stored in Git. You control what templates are available, what parameters are exposed, and what gets created. Developers just fill in the blanks.

== Part 3: What Ops Keeps Running

Now that you've seen what developers get, here's how you monitor and maintain RHDH.

=== Step 6: View RHDH Resources in OpenShift

In the OpenShift console:

1. Go to **Workloads** -> **Pods**
2. Select the **backstage** project
3. You'll see `backstage-developer-hub` and `backstage-psql-developer-hub` pods

View via CLI:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get pods -n backstage
----

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get deployment -n backstage
----

=== Step 7: Check Configuration

RHDH configuration is stored in ConfigMaps:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get configmaps -n backstage
----

View secrets (database credentials, OAuth tokens):

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get secrets -n backstage
----

=== Step 8: View Logs and Health

Check application logs:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc logs -n backstage -l rhdh.redhat.com/app=backstage-developer-hub --tail=30
----

Check health endpoint:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
curl -sk $(oc get route backstage-developer-hub -n backstage -o jsonpath='https://{.spec.host}')/.backstage/health/v1/readiness
----

You should see `{"status":"ok"}`.

=== Step 9: Resource Usage

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc adm top pods -n backstage
----
