## MachineSets, Machines, and Nodes

Kubernetes `Nodes` are where containers are orchestrated and run in `Pods`.
OpenShift 4 is fundamentally different than OpenShift 3 with respect to its
focus on automated operations through the use of `Operators`. With respect
to `Nodes`, there is a set of `Operators` and controllers that are focused on
maintaining the state of the cluster size -- including creating and
destroying `Nodes`!

### MachineSets and Machines
As you saw in the application management exercises, there is a basic
fundamental relationship between a `ReplicaSet`/`ReplicationController` and
the `Pods` it creates. Similarly, there is a relationship between a
`MachineSet` and a `Machine`.

The `MachineSet` defines a desired state for a set of `Machine` objects. When
using IPI installations, then, there is an `Operator` whose job it is to make
sure that there is actually an underlying instance for each `Machine` and,
finally, that every `Machine` becomes a `Node`.

Execute the following:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get machineset.machine.openshift.io -n openshift-machine-api
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME                                    DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AVAILABLE   AGE
cluster-6ljsd-9b8vz-worker-us-east-2a   1         1         1       1           167m
cluster-6ljsd-9b8vz-worker-us-east-2b   1         1         1       1           167m
cluster-6ljsd-9b8vz-worker-us-east-2c   0         0                             167m
----

When OpenShift was installed, the installer interrogated the cloud provider
to learn about the available AZs (since this is on AWS). It then ultimately
created a `MachineSet` for each AZ and then scaled those sets, in order,
until it reached the desired number of `Machines`. Since the default
installation has 2 workers, the first 2 AZs got one worker each. The rest got
zero.

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get machine.machine.openshift.io -n openshift-machine-api
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME                                          PHASE     TYPE          REGION      ZONE         AGE
cluster-pn5pp-g5lb8-master-0                  Running   m5a.2xlarge   us-east-2   us-east-2a   6h34m
cluster-pn5pp-g5lb8-master-1                  Running   m5a.2xlarge   us-east-2   us-east-2b   6h34m
cluster-pn5pp-g5lb8-master-2                  Running   m5a.2xlarge   us-east-2   us-east-2c   6h34m
cluster-pn5pp-g5lb8-worker-us-east-2a-ljf99   Running   m6a.8xlarge   us-east-2   us-east-2a   6h29m
cluster-pn5pp-g5lb8-worker-us-east-2b-j2w27   Running   m6a.8xlarge   us-east-2   us-east-2b   6h29m
----

Each `Machine` has a corresponding `INSTANCE`. Do those IDs look familiar?
They are AWS EC2 instance IDs. You also see `Machines` for the OpenShift
masters. They are not part of a `MachineSet` because they are somewhat
stateful and their management is handled by different operators and through a
different process. If you have a different number of worker machines, 
it doesn't matter as we will be adding more later.

[Warning]
====
There is currently no protection for the master `Machines`. Do not
accidentally or intentionally delete them, as this will potentially break
your cluster. It is repairable, but it is not fun.
====

Lastly, execute:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes
----

You will see something like:

----
NAME                                        STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION
ip-10-0-22-105.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready    control-plane,master   6h33m   v1.28.10+a2c84a5
ip-10-0-44-60.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready    worker                 6h27m   v1.28.10+a2c84a5
ip-10-0-49-34.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready    control-plane,master   6h34m   v1.28.10+a2c84a5
ip-10-0-5-241.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready    worker                 6h27m   v1.28.10+a2c84a5
ip-10-0-75-11.us-east-2.compute.internal    Ready    control-plane,master   6h34m   v1.28.10+a2c84a5
----

Each `Machine` ends up corresponding to a `Node`. With IPI, there is a
bootstrap process where the machine operator will create an EC2 instance and
then Ignition inside the RHEL CoreOS operating system will receive initial
instructions from the operator. This results in the EC2 instance being
configured as an OpenShift node and joining the cluster.

If you spend some time using `oc describe` and the various `Machine` and
`Node` objects, you will figure out which ones correlate with which.

### Cluster Scaling
Because of the magic of `Operators` and the way in which OpenShift uses them
to manage `Machines` and `Nodes`, scaling your cluster in OpenShift 4 is
extremely trivial.

Look at the list of `MachineSets` again:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get machineset.machine.openshift.io -n openshift-machine-api
----

Within that list, we will scale one of the `MachineSet` objects with the
`oc scale` command. Run:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
CLUSTERNAME=$(oc get infrastructure cluster -o=jsonpath='{.status.infrastructureName}')
ZONENAME=$(oc get nodes --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp' -o=jsonpath='{.items[-1:].metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone}')
oc scale machineset.machine.openshift.io ${CLUSTERNAME}-worker-${ZONENAME} -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=3
----

Take special note the `MachineSet` scaled is likely different from
the one that is shown in the lab guide. You should see a note that the
`MachineSet` was successfully scaled. Now, look at the list of `Machines`:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get machine.machine.openshift.io -n openshift-machine-api
----

You probably already have new entries for 2 new `Machine` with a `STATE` of
`Pending`. After a few moments, both will have a corresponding EC2 instance ID
and will look something like:

----
cluster-f4a3-lpxbs-worker-us-east-2c-h7gdt   i-0b9208ec47f0e206b   running   m6a.8xlarge     us-east-2   us-east-2c   47s
----

At this point, in the background, the bootstrap process is happening
automatically. After several minutes (up to five or so), take a look at the
output of:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc get nodes
----

You should see your fresh and happy new nodes. They are the ones with a very young age:

----
ip-10-0-34-107.us-east-2.compute.internal   Ready   worker   44s    v1.28.10+a2c84a5
----

[NOTE]
====
It can take several minutes for a `Machine` to be prepared and added
as a `Node`. You can follow the process by running a `watch` against
`oc get nodes` if you wish.
====

Scale the `MachineSet` from two back down to one before continuing.

[Warning]
====
Make sure you've set the ${CLUSTERNAME} and ${ZONENAME} varaible from
when you scaled up, a few steps ago.
====

First we will patch the deletePolicy of the machineset to delete only the newest machines:

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc patch machineset.machine.openshift.io ${CLUSTERNAME}-worker-${ZONENAME} -n openshift-machine-api --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"deletePolicy":"Newest"}}'
----

Then we will scale down the machineset

[source,bash,role="execute"]
----
oc scale machineset.machine.openshift.io ${CLUSTERNAME}-worker-${ZONENAME} -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=1
----
